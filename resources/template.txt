Dear <<Recipient>>,

My name is <<Name>><<Residency>>. I am emailing to demand your condemnation of the police brutality which has occurred under your leadership. You were elected by the people to serve all members of your community. Your constituents require your immediate action to protect our friends, neighbors and community as a whole.

I demand justice for the citizens of <<Location>> who have been hit by rubber bullets, tear gassed, and abused in the videos attached to this email for exercising their first amendment rights during a peaceful protest. We need our representatives to regain control of this situation and remedy this injustice. The people you represent are demanding reparations and justice. 

Moving forward we demand the creation of an independent inspector body to investigate police misconduct and requirements for the state to establish board certification with minimum education and training requirements for police officers. It is necessary to refocus police resources on training, de-escalation, and community building. I demand our city adopts the “absolute necessity doctrine for lethal force” and codify the requirement for police to have positive control over the evidence chain of custody.

Our home is not immune to the realities striking the nation at this moment; there is recorded video evidence of our community members facing police brutality from a system you have power over. Linked below are members of our city’s police department engaging in police brutality against peaceful protesters:

As community leadership, you have a responsibility to do what is best for your people as well as to protect and serve the members within your district.The system that is meant to protect us is the system that is hurting our community, and you were elected to represent and fight for us when our voices are not being heard. This is the time to use your position to fight for your communities and demand justice.

Regards,
