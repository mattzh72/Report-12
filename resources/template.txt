Dear <<Recipient>>,

My name is <<Name>>, and I am <<Age>>. <<Residency>>I am writing to demand justice for the citizens of <<Insert City and State>> who have been made victims to police brutality while exercising their first amendment rights during peaceful protests. Your constituents require your immediate action to make reprimands for the excessive use of force and unjustified use of rubber bullets and tear gas demonstrated in the videos linked at the end of this email. 

Moving forward, we call for the implementation of the five following points; the creation of an independent body to investigate police misconduct; increased training requirements for police officers with an emphasis on de-escalation and community-building; allocating police resources towards the aforementioned emphasis; the adoption of the “absolute necessity doctrine for lethal force”; and revising the current processes and checks in place regarding the evidence chain of custody. 

As an elected official, you took an oath to serve the people and defend their constitutional rights, the same rights which are being violated by members of your city’s police department. We need you to address this situation, correct the injustices that have occurred, and initiate change to create a criminal justice system free of racial bias.

It is your responsibility. This is the time to use your position to fight for your community.

Regards,
<<Insert Name>>
